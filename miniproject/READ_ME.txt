****MINI PROJECT ON MACRO PRE-PROCESSOR****


Source Code:	macro.py

Step 1: Run this file.

It will take input from different input files


	NOTE: To take input from corresponding files replace the filename in the source code.
	      Comments starts from double tild sign (~~)
	      Every macro name ends with "(a,b,c,..........)" which signifies the position of passed arguments.
	      If no arguments are passed it is simply "()"


1) c_input.txt contains Single line macro, multi line macros and commented macros of C language. Replace with "obj = open("c_input.txt", "r")" .

2) p_input.txt contains Single line macro, multi line macros and commented macros of Python. Replace with "obj = open("p_input.txt", "r")" .

3) asm_input.txt contains Single line macro, multi line macros and commented macros of NASM. Replace with "obj = open("asm_input.txt", "r")" .
	
Step 2: Output will appear on Terminal. Output will be the corresponding language source code after Pre-processing.
